CSSImages

This idea is more a proof of concept than anything else. You feed an image into the script (currently only accepts PNG) and it converts this image pixel for pixel into a HTML table, styled with CSS. 

What's the use of it? There aren't many really. As I said, it's more a proof of concept. It has been suggested for use as a signature for emails as that way an image blocker won't stop it from displaying.

Examples: cheetah.html and panda.html are examples of what it can generate. Please be aware that cheetah.html is a HUGE file and it WILL slow down your browser. I suggest playing with panda.html first.
